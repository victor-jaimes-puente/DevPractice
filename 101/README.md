# 101 Exercises for JS

## Rationale
101 Exercises exists as a self-test tool for learning JS fundamentals including data types, operators, and writing user defined fuctions. There are also exercises for practicing with collections such as arrays, objects, and arrays of objects. 

## Quick Start
1. Create yourself an account on Glitch.com
2. Click on the fish icon in the upper right and select "Remix on Glitch" to make your own copy
3. Use Glitch.com as your editor

## Orientation
- `index.html` is the page that runs all the JS contained in `101-exercises.js`
- Open the JavaScript console in Firefox or Chrome. F12 usually works.
- Start writing solutions inside of 101-exercises.js in the editor.
- Refresh `index.html` to re-run any new changes from 101-exercises.js

## Rationale
- 101 Exercises exists to help learners gain deep practice with fundamentals, operators, syntax, and converting problems in English to solutions in JS.
- The best way to learn how to program is write programs. Each exercise is a tiny little program.
- Expect to do a tremendous amount of search engine searches, make many mistakes, and try again. This is all part of programming. Take breaks.

    <h3>General Guidance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>JS Code runs from top to bottom</li>
        <li>Any error in your JS code keeps the following code from running.</li>
        <li>Double check your spelling. Capitalization matters in programming.</li>
        <li>If you're sure you spelled something, check it anyways.</li>
